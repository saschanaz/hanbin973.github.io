However, most statistical &amp; population genetics articles were less familiar to me in their organization. This page aims to list theorems and methods regarding statistical &amp; population genetics in a theorem-proof structure so that I can readily access when I need them. "],
["linkage-disequilibrium-score-regression-ldsc.html", "Chapter 3 Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) 3.1 Univariate LDSC", " Chapter 3 Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) is a popular method in statistical genetics with a wide range of application. It is used to measure confounding due to population structure, computing genetic correlation and heritability. Most of all, the method can be performed soley on summary statistics rather than the full data which reduces memeory and computation requirements tremendously. 3.1 Univariate LDSC The original from of LDSC (here we call it Univariate LDSC) can be used to estimate SNP heritability and confounding effects of population structure (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015). I refer the supplementary notes of Bulik-Sullivan et al. (2015) for the notations. Definition 3.1 (LD score) Define the LD Score of variant \\(j\\) as \\[ l_j = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} r_{jk}^2 \\] Then for a homogenous sample without population structure, the following holds. Theorem 3.1 (LDSC without structure) In a sample without population structure \\[ {\\mathbb{E}}[\\chi_j^2] = \\frac{Nh_g^2}{M} l_j +1 \\] holds. If a population structure (measured by the fixation index \\(F_{ST}\\)) exists, a non-zero constant is added to Theorem 3.1 . Theorem 3.2 (General LDSC) In a sample with population structure \\[ {\\mathbb{E}}[\\chi_j^2] = \\frac{Nh_g^2}{M} l_j + 1 + aNF_{ST} \\] holds. Proof. \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\mathrm{Var}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}] &amp;= {\\mathbb{E}}[{\\mathrm{Var}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}|X]]+{\\mathrm{Var}}[{\\mathbb{E}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}|X]] \\\\ &amp;= {\\mathbb{E}}[{\\mathrm{Var}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}|X]] + 0 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] The second term vanishes since \\({\\mathbb{E}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}|X]= 0\\). Inspecting the first term, \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\mathrm{Var}}[\\hat{\\beta_j}|X] &amp;= \\frac{1}{N^2} {\\mathrm{Var}}[X_j^T \\phi|X] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{N^2} X_j^T {\\mathrm{Var}}[\\phi|X] X_j \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( \\frac{h_g^2}{M}X_j^T XX^T X_j + N(1-h_g^2) \\right) \\end{aligned}\\] References "],
