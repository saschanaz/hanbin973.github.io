# Mendelian Randomization

Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a special case of the Instrumental Variable (IV) which is widely used in econometrics.
MR employs genetic variants (e.g. SNP) as IVs since genotypes are automatically randomized in the gametic phase of cell division.

## Simple MR

## Two-sample MR

## MR-Egger
