This series will be a note on Motoo Kimura's [review paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3211856?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) on diffusion models.

Because I have a mathematical background, some terms that seems to be non-rigorous to me will be noted in this article. 
Then, some additional explanation will be added to them but this will be based on my personal viewpoint.
Therefore, some logical gaps might remain.

This post will introduce basic settings for future discussions.

In page 182, Kimura defines _continuous stochastic process_ as follows
> if for any given positive value $\epsilon>0$, the probability that the change in $x$ during the time interval $(t,t+\delta t)$ exceeds $\epsilon$ is $o(\delta t)$.

The probabilitistic definition of continuous stochastic process has a number of derivations depending on the type of limit we use in analysis.
The definition closest to the above definition given by Kimura can be stated as
\begin{align}
    \lim_{s \rightarrow t} \mathbf{P}\left( \\{ \omega \in \Omega: |X_s(\omega)-X_t(\omega)| \geq \epsilon \\} \right) = 0
\end{align}

However, this needs a little bit more refinement,
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{P}(\\{ \omega \in \Omega: |X_s(\omega)-X_t(\omega)| \geq \epsilon \\} ) = o(s-t)
\end{align}
resulting a slightly stronger condition.

Due to the definition of _small-o_ notation, it is equivalent to the following.
\begin{align}
    \lim_{s \rightarrow t} \frac{\mathbf{P}(\\{ \omega \in \Omega: |X_s(\omega)-X_t(\omega)| \geq \epsilon \\} )}{|s-t|} = 0
\end{align}

Now, let's define an appropriate random variables for density $\phi(p,x;t)$ and $g(\delta x,x;\delta t, t)$ in page 182.

Let $X_t$ a random variable representing the frequency of a given allele at time $t$.
Then by the definition of probability density,
\begin{align}
    P(X_t \in [a,b]) = \int_{[a,b]} \phi(p,x;t) dx
\end{align}

For $g(\delta x,x;\delta t, t)$, define  $Y_{t, \delta t} = X_{t+\delta t}-X_t$.
Then we see that $g(\delta x,x;\delta t, t)$ is the conditional density $f_t$ of the following equation.
\begin{align}
    P(|Y_{\delta t, t}| \geq \epsilon|X_t=x) = \int_{|y| \geq \epsilon} f_{\delta t,t}(y|x)dy
\end{align}

Now we are done with definitions. 
From the next post, we will restate the theorems of Kimura(1964) using the terms we defined today.
