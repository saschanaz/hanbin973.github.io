Fisher demonstrated the 'Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection' in _The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection_(1930).
This article gives the proof of this theorem under an ideal condition although the theorem also holds under general conditions.
More general cases will be shown later in this blog.

The theorem states that _'the change in mean fitness is proportional to it's genetic variance'_.
However, the simple case presented below will not account for genetic information of the population.
This simple case does not even consider Mendelian inheritance.

Suppose that there are $k$ different groups in a given population with size $N_i$ and fitness $\{w_i\}$. Note that $w_i$ is a constant unique to each subgroup $i=1 \sim k$.

We assume that the growth of population is free from restrictions, which means that we assume an exponential growth model of the following
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = w_i
\end{equation}

The mean fitness $\overline{w} = (1/N)\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_iN_i$ can be seen as a function repect to time. Therefore, differentiating it gives the rate of change in mean fitness.
\begin{align}
        \frac{d \, \overline{w}}{dt} &= \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (dN_i/dt) ) \cdot N - (\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_iw_i) \cdot (dN/dt)}{N^2} \newline
                                     &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 - \overline{w}^2 \newline
                                     &= Var(w)
\end{align}
which completes the proof.
