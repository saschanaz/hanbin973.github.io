Family history is a well-known predictor for some diseases.
Cancer is one of them and there are number of studies trying to identify to what extent does family history increases the risk of cancer.
However, it seems that these reports might be confounded by overdiagnosis resulting overestimations.


An [article](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/47/2/440/4638472) published in IJE this April has analzyed a cohort from Sweden, reporting that people with family history has a higher risk of gastric cancer.

The data contained samples from a nation-wide biopsy cohort linked to a nation-wide cancer registry.
Then they classified the groups according to their family history status and computed SID (Standardized incidence ratios) and HR (Hazard ratios).

The problem was that I failed to find any information about cancer check-up/diagnosis frequencies in the main article nor the supplmentaries.
It is well-known that increased cancer check-ups can lead to increased reporting of cancer incidences.
This means that if the groups being compared have different check-up freqeuncy, their differences in cancer incidences might be a result of different check-up frequency rather than a true difference between the groups.

What I first thought was that because people with family history are more aware of their health, this can lead to systematic increase in engaing to health check-ups that can lead to increased reporting of cancer.

I'm not sure how it is in Sweden, but in Korea, there are evidences (for example, [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635590/)) that people with family history are more likely to get a health check-up.

Does anyone have an opinion about this?
